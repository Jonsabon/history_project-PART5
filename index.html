    The Kamikaze Corps were notorious for their suicide mission against the Allied Navy Forces. They were first a group of 24 volunteer pilots from Japan's 201st Navy Air Group, and ultimately unsuccessful in their last effort. The Kamikaze were successful in changing history, and they did well by showing their perseverance and dedication to win through their fighting tactics.
</p>
<p>
    To start it off, the Kamikaze was effective in the sense of mass destruction. In most of their battles, they sunk at least 34 ships, at the battle of Okinawa, the kamikaze wreaked havoc, amounting to nearly five thousand men dead. This clearly proves that the Kamikaze weren’t that useless, causing a ton of damage, with added psychological damage to the spectators, it is a certainty that this aspect of the Kamikaze corps did really well. With such devastating results, it's no wonder that the Kamikaze was considered by some to be a desperate but effective tactic during World War II.
</p>
<p>
    Next, the Kamikaze was added as a desperate final push against American Forces. They were in a clear losing position in the war against American and Allied forces. Struggling to keep together the empire, the Japanese formed the Kamikaze Corps as a final counterattack against the Americans. This clearly points to their unwillingness to surrender, since they could have just resigned, and it would have been an easy battle for America, but they decided to keep the war afloat. As they tried to wrangle some pilots to start this group, it’s a shame that it was a final and desperate final pushback against the American and Allied Forces.
</p>
<p>
    To end this, The Kamikaze affected the course of history on both sides of the battle. The Americans would have been completely different if it hadn’t been for the Japanese last and insanely desperate attempt to push back their forces, since the attack really messed with the Americans' decision making. They thought that they would sacrifice pilots to win, so they had to change their plans drastically. On the other hand, Japan’s history would have been completely different, if it hadn’t been for the bushido code existing, since they die before they surrender (also known as dishonor), they sacrifice themselves to avoid dishonor to their bloodline, and that is what the kamikaze revolved around. The Americans’ and the Japanese would have been 2 completely different superpowers compared to these superpowers. America would have been racist towards asians, disallowing the Japanese, and would have been a hell to live in, and Japan wouldn’t have been this futuristic and advanced with their technology, instead they would have been Americans’ living there, since they would have been too weak to fend for themselves. The timeline of events stringing the very fabric of Americas’ and Japanese history revolving around the kamikaze is surprising, which is why most people debate that Japan and America would be different, if it hadn’t been for them squabbling.
</p>
<p>
    The success that the Kamikaze corps had on history and how they showed their unwillingness to surrender and perseverance through their final act gives an idea on how the Kamikaze truly was important in the timeline of events leading up to the present, and how important the past is to the present. Their unwillingness to surrender was based on the bushido code, and how they should off themselves before surrendering, also known as dishonor. They also showed perseverance through their final war tactic by delivering a surprise on the American navy by making kamikaze pilots commit suicide and inflicting heavy casualty onto them, shocking them as consequence.  Their success in changing history is monumental, since if they hadn’t, many items and ideologies would have been altered by a majority. To be honest, the kamikaze wasn’t that in vain, since it shaped how our relationships are now with Japan, and overall, this was a big success.
